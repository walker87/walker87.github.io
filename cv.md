I’m writing to apply for the position of Senior Technical Writer in your Belfast office.  I have nine years experience working in software, hardware, manufacturing, clinical environments and have written everything from simple Warranty Statements to Clinical Applications for FDA submission to technical documents for developers.  I have worked with developers, testers, trainers, designers, product owners, release managers and of course other technical writers based in the UK and abroad. 

I have a BA (hons) degree in Information Communication Technologies.  I am also a certified STC Professional Technical Communicator, Certified MadCap Flare Advanced Developer, Certified XML Master (certification gained through Prometric), Microsoft Certified IT Professional, Technology Specialist and Solutions Associate.  Furthermore, I am a Microsoft Certified Professional Community member and STC Professional and Academic member.

When I'm not authoring technical documents, I enjoy bouldering and keeping fit, growing my own vegetables and gardening, travelling, eating sushi and reading Stephen King novels. 

When I saw your job opening, I knew it was the perfect opportunity to show you both my technical writing skills/experience and furthermore progress my career with a market leading company that embraces a healthy work-life balance.  I’d love to speak with you about the role.  Please feel free to email me or give me a call to discuss why I would be a good fit for your company.  My email address is walker.r87@googlemail.com and mobile number is +447841636265.  I hope to hear from you soon.

Thanks, and best regards,

Richard Walker
